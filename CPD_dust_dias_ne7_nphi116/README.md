This is the "first" succesfful run of 10^7 photons for the CPD model in the cluster. For some reason , any nphi >116 will run extremely slowly.
Checking the mockmodel.py, and the temperature outputs
I also corrected back mstar to 1.5 Msun and tstar to 4000 K
nr       = 150 
ntheta   = 80
nphi     = 116
