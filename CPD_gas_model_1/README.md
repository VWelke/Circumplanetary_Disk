# This is the first CO model that I attempt to create for my CPD model. But for the velocity profiles - I don't know if thery are different for the CPD and PPD or not

# Let incl be 50 degrees, phi remain 0



# first try to run with 10^6 photons
# what wavelengths do I need 
# check vphi     = np.sqrt(G*mstar/rr)

#abunco = 1e-4
factco = abunco/(2.3*mp)
nco    = rhog*factco

# What is the dust-to-gas ratio in CPD and PPD?
# What is the gas formula? do I stil need the dust formula
